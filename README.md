Having a refreshing vacation in Panaji, you are headed home to Chennai. However, due to a
weather emergency, all flights from Panaji have been cancelled and the only way for you to get
home in time is opting for road transport.

Matters have been further complicated by some technical issue with Google maps making
them unavailable for the time being. Your only saving grace is your knowledge of A star algorithm
